# Shared command contracts

The installed interface is `node skills/repo-audit/scripts/repo-audit.mjs <command> [options]`.
Resource paths are relative to the installed skill, never the caller's current directory.
Command-specific options and input formats belong to their owning tasks and command help.
C4a establishes arguments, targets, paths, scratch and results.
Production dispatch and schema validation follow in C4c.

## Arguments and targets

Options use `--name value`, with a separate, nonempty value.
`--json` is a boolean flag.
Unknown arguments, positional arguments, repeated options, missing values and `--name=value` are usage errors.
Argument validation collects detected problems before refusing an operation.
Each command registers its own value options with `parseArgs`.

Exactly one explicit target is required.
`--repo <path>` selects an existing Git working tree and resolves its real Git top level, including when selected from a subdirectory or before its first commit.
A bare repo or non-Git directory is blocked, with a Git prerequisite and fix.
`--workspace <path>` is accepted only by draft-only commands and resolves an existing directory that need not contain Git.
The two target options are mutually exclusive.
Relative target paths resolve from the caller's working directory.
Target identity is `{ mode: "repo" | "workspace", root: <absolute real path> }`.
Links to the target share that identity.
Draft commands do not initialise Git, create a repo or write foundation files.
The separately selected creation operation belongs to T2.9.

## Target-relative paths

`resolvePath(root, input)` accepts a nonempty relative path and returns its resolved absolute path inside the real target root.
Absolute paths, Windows drive paths, NUL bytes and parent traversal components using either slash are refused.
Spaces, Unicode and metacharacters remain literal path characters.
For a new path, resolution starts with its nearest existing parent.
Existing links must resolve inside the target, including parents of new files.
Dangling links are refused rather than treated as absent directories.
Internal links are allowed and return their real destination.
No validation operation creates target files or directories.
Callers validate all inputs and paths before any write, and report every detected problem.
This is path preflight, not the reviewed atomic-write and concurrent-change protection built in T2.6.
Callers must recheck paths and reviewed bytes at that later write boundary.

## Scratch

Drafts, board verdicts and resume state stay outside the selected target.
`createScratch(target)` creates one run directory under the OS cache folder:

| OS | Cache folder |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bstack\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Caches/bstack/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bstack/`, otherwise `~/.cache/bstack/` |

The cache directory must be absolute.
A target subfolder uses SHA-256 of the absolute real target root, and a UUID identifies each run.
Existing cache and run-parent links are resolved before creating directories.
A resolved scratch location inside the target is blocked before any write.
The returned absolute run path is explicit input to later resume operations, rather than guessing the newest run.
Scratch is retained for review and resume, with no automatic deletion in C4a.

## Results

With `--json`, stdout contains exactly one JSON object:

```json
{"schemaVersion":1,"command":"contract-test","status":"passed","problems":[],"data":{},"inputs":{}}
```

| Status | Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `passed` | 0 | The requested operation passed |
| `failed` | 1 | Input data or a completed check failed |
| `blocked` | 2 | A prerequisite is missing or inaccessible |
| `usage-error` | 3 | Arguments or target-relative paths are invalid |

Each problem has `code`, `message`, `fix` and an optional `path`.
`data` contains the command's results and `inputs` identifies the target and relevant declared inputs.
Without `--json`, the command prints a short status summary and each problem's fix with the same exit code.
Child output must go to captured artifacts, never alongside the JSON envelope.
Child execution and fingerprints follow in C4b.

## Structured inputs and later contracts

Every structured format declares `schemaVersion: 1` and rejects unknown fields.
Owning tasks define exact required contents and reject missing or duplicate joining IDs.
C4c adds the supported schema keywords and rejects unsupported keywords.
The plan's child-command object, exact-byte SHA-256 preconditions and substantive-input fingerprint contracts remain authoritative for C4b.
No schema validator, child runner or fingerprint implementation is claimed by C4a.

## C4a public test command

`node tests/inputs/contract.mjs --mode draft --workspace <directory> --input tests/inputs/draft.json --json` exercises the shared library without changing production dispatch.
`--mode repo --repo <directory>` exercises the Git mode.
Its input is `{ "schemaVersion": 1, "paths": [<relative path>], "scratch": <boolean> }` with no additional fields.
It validates all paths before optionally writing `draft.txt` in a new scratch run.
Valid and invalid fixtures in `tests/inputs/` cover refusal with no partial writes.
`npm test -- --task T0.4.C4a` selects this slice, and `--task T0.4` selects the currently implemented parent-task tests.
T0.4 remains incomplete until C4b and C4c pass.
